### overview

Files and scripts used for testing enrichment of de novo mutations (DNMs) in schizophrenia probands 

### files

Files used for various analyses
  * DNM list
  * Trio counts
  * Per-gene mutation expectations
  * gene sets

### DNM calling

[Scripts](https://github.com/howrigan/trio_sequence_analysis/tree/master/dnm_calling) used to parse VCF file to get DNM calls and run variant annotation

### Exome burden

[Script](https://github.com/howrigan/trio_sequence_analysis/tree/master/exome_burden) for determining exome-wide burden of coding DNMs against control trios and mutation model expectations

### Geneset enrichment

[Scripts](https://github.com/howrigan/trio_sequence_analysis/tree/master/geneset_enrichment) for testing relative enrichment of DNMs in a specific gene set relative to full DNM list

### Gene enrichment

[Scripts](https://github.com/howrigan/trio_sequence_analysis/tree/master/gene_enrichment) for testing single gene DNM rates against mutation model expectations
